  My name is David Muto and I’m a code-aholic! I’ve been a professional developer in Toronto, Canada for over 10 years. I have a real passion for development, and strive to do the best job possible on every project I work on.

  Having worked within the industry for a while now, I have a solid understanding of the full lifecycle of a software development project and have a ton of experience learning and implementing new and emerging technologies.

  While the bulk of my experience is with .NET, I’m a firm believer that developers should be polyglots and as such I am able to write high quality code in C#, C/C++, Objective-C, Java, JavaScript and Ruby. I also (in my spare time) work with Python.

  Being a full stack developer and equally comfortable in Windows and ‘Nix environments, I am able to quickly bring myself up to speed on desktop, mobile and web applications regardless of their platform or size. I firmly believe developers should work on all aspects of their applications, for web, this means front end, back end and dev ops.

  I have a strong foundation in TDD and strive for 100% coverage in all of the code I write. This has given me production experience with several testing frameworks including MSTest, nUnit, xUnit, SenTest, Kiwi, RSpec, Cucumber and Jasmine, to name a few...

  In a previous life I used to care about certifications, so I am a Sun Certified Java Developer and a Microsoft Certified Professional Developer (MCPD).
