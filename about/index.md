    <blockquote>My name is David Muto and I’m a code-aholic! I’ve been a professional developer in Toronto, Canada for over 10 years. I have a real passion for development, and strive to do the best job possible on every project I work on.</blockquote>

    <p>I work on large scale (20M+ uniques per year) projects in C#, Ruby on Rails, C and Objective-C. My focus of late has been on TDD, MVC (.NET and Ruby), and performance-based development principals and practices.</p>

    <p>I would say my strongest 5 languages are C#, C/++, Ruby, Python and JavaScript (I know it really well).</p>

    <p>I use Test Driven Development and eXtreme Programming practices regardless of the language/environment I’m working in.</p>

    <p>Finally, I am a Sun Certified Java Developer and a Microsoft Certified Professional Developer (MCPD).</p>
