      <description>Once in a while, I find myself implementing the same helper functions in different pages. In an effort to not repeat myself, I generally move helper functions into a common cshtml file in App_Code (as suggested here).
While this works great for a single application, Iâ€™ve found myself copying helpers from project to project.
So in order to avoid the copy-paste nightmare, I decided to see if I could abstract the basic functionality into an extension method and then have application specific rendering.</description>

      <description>Recently I needed to show a drop down list of all of the enumeration values. So I did what we all do and hit up Google. While there was plenty of information out there detailing how to convert the enum to a Dictionary&amp;lt;int, string&amp;gt; and render it, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find something that fit my needs.
Essentially I have an enumeration of field types. I wanted to display the names of those fields in a drop down list, but be able to make some of them prettier.</description>

      <description>While I&amp;rsquo;m loving MVC3 and the Razor view engine, I was sorely disappointed when I couldn&amp;rsquo;t use the system.web/pages/namespaces collection in web.config to add global namespace includes.
After a bit of hunting and looking through the web.config files underneath the views folder (in each Area), I found that this can be accomplished by adding the following to the root web.config file:
 Now you can add any namespaces you require under the new razor namespaces section.</description>
