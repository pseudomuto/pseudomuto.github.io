      <description>I recently started playing around with EmberJS. While I was insanely impressed with how easy it was to get a single-page app up and running, I was having difficulty getting QUnit setup correctly.
After some finagling I was able to get it working. In my particular case I&amp;rsquo;m using Ruby 2.0.0 and Rails 4.0.0, though I&amp;rsquo;m sure this same setup would work with previous versions with minimal (if any) tweaks.</description>
