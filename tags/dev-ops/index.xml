      <description>I recently wanted to setup a subversion server. Initially I thought of using Beanstalk since they handle pretty much everything for you for a very small monthly fee. However, I thought I might set up my own server in order to learn the process.
I found a few online resources that outlined the process, but none of them were exactly what I needed, so I decided to write this post to go over the steps in detail.</description>
