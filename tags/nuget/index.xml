      <description>Recently I had the opportunity to work with GitHub&amp;rsquo;s API again. This time I was particularily interested in the Repo Contents API. The goal was to be able to publish files from disk or embedded resource (read: stream) directly to a GitHub repo without having to clone the repo somewhere and then issue a git push.
The API seemed (as is always with case with the GitHub API) straightforward and had methods for creating and updating files.</description>
