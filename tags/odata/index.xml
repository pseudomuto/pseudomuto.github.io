      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on an iOS project that loads data that we publish via the Open Data Protocol.
At first everything was working perfectly. I was using JSONKit and NSOperation to download and process the information. That was until I had to get a DateTime object&amp;hellip;which resulted in an epic fail!
It turns out that WCF Data Services publish DateTime objects as a new Date object represented by the time in milliseconds (not seconds) since January 1, 1970.</description>
