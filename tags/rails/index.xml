      <description>Monitoring your application is important - full stop. When the response time plummet&amp;rsquo;s you want to know before your customers do&amp;hellip;and certainly before you bother to check your twitter feed.
There are lots of options here, and a lot of them require a ton of upfront investment in terms of time and effort. However, a simple way to get started is to simply log total request durations and track the number of successful and failed responses.</description>

      <description>I use vagrant (along with chef, a vagrant plugin and my dotfiles) for my development environment. I do this for a number of reasons, but mostly, I find it&amp;rsquo;s the easiest way to get everything installed and configured properly regardless of which physical box I&amp;rsquo;m working on.
There are a number of issues I needed to address to get this all working. One of those, was getting a simple rails server from inside the VM to be available from my host&amp;rsquo;s browser.</description>

      <title>Application Templates for Rails</title>

      <description>Frequently I find myself creating basic rails apps to demonstrate a new feature, or prototype something for a spike test. Every time I created an app, I would run rails new -T, then add RSpec, Cucumber, Haml, possibly Bootstrap, etc.
After the 10th app in a month, I decided that there must be an easier way. Then I saw this post: http://everydayrails.com/2011/02/28/rails-3-application-templates.html
I started reading up on generators and application templates, then I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write my own, to see how it works.</description>
